# arc CLI

The `arc` build tool for Arc applications. Handles everything needed to go
from a Go source tree to a native, distributable host binary — without
requiring a `git` binary or manual CMake setup.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/carbon-os/arc/cmd/cli@latest
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"

GOPROXY=direct go install github.com/carbon-os/arc/cmd/arc@latest
```

Or build from source in the repo root:

```bash
go build -o arc ./cmd/cli
```

## Usage

```bash
arc <command> [flags]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `arc build` | Clone/update libarc, compile your Go module, generate and configure `arc-project/` |
| `arc help` | Print usage information |

---

## `arc build`

```bash
arc build [-o name] [go-build-flags] [package]
```

The only command you need for a production build. Runs the following steps in order:

**1. Clone or update libarc**

Uses [go-git v5](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) — a pure Go git
implementation bundled into the `arc` binary — to clone or update
`https://github.com/carbon-os/arc` into `arc-project/libarc/`. No `git`
binary is required on the host machine.

**2. Build libarc with CMake**

Configures and builds libarc in Release mode inside `arc-project/libarc/build/`,
then copies the resulting shared library into `arc-project/`. On Windows,
`VCPKG_ROOT` must be set.

**3. Compile your Go module**

Injects a temporary `_arc_entry.go` stub into your package, then calls
`go build -buildmode=c-shared` to produce `arc-project/libarc-module.{ext}`.
The stub exports `AppMain` — the symbol libarc calls in production mode. It
is always removed after the build, even on failure.

**4. Generate `arc-project/`**

Writes a `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.cpp` alongside the compiled libraries.
The `main.cpp` is identical on every platform and never needs to be edited.

**5. Pre-configure the CMake build tree**

Runs `cmake -B arc-project/build` so the project is ready to build or open
in an IDE immediately.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-o name` | Name of the final host binary. Defaults to the current directory name. |

Any other flags (e.g. `-race`, `-tags`) are forwarded verbatim to `go build`.

### Examples

```bash
# Standard build
arc build .

# Custom output binary name
arc build -o myapp .

# With extra go build flags
arc build -race -o myapp .
```

### After running `arc build`

```
your-app/
├── main.go                        ← your app, untouched
├── go.mod
│
└── arc-project/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt             ← auto-generated
    ├── main.cpp                   ← auto-generated host entry point
    ├── libarc-module.dylib        ← your compiled Go logic
    ├── libarc.dylib               ← native webview + run loop
    ├── libarc/                    ← full libarc source (for Xcode / debugging)
    └── build/                     ← cmake build tree, configured and ready
```

To produce the final host binary:

```bash
cd arc-project && cmake --build build
```

Or open `arc-project/` directly in Xcode for a full native debug session with
breakpoints, Instruments, and the memory graph.

## Platform requirements

| Platform | Requirements |
| :--- | :--- |
| macOS | Xcode Command Line Tools, CMake ≥ 3.22 |
| Windows | Visual Studio 2022, CMake ≥ 3.22, vcpkg (`VCPKG_ROOT` must be set) |
| Linux | GCC or Clang, CMake ≥ 3.22, `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev` |

On Linux, install the webview dependencies before running `arc build`:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel
```

---

## Development vs production

`arc build` is only needed to produce a distributable binary. During
day-to-day development you don't use it at all:

```bash
go run .
```

The Go arc package spawns the renderer as a subprocess and drives it over IPC.
No CMake, no C compiler, no Xcode required.

| | Development | Production |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Command | `go run .` | `arc build` then `cmake --build` |
| Process model | Two processes (Go + renderer) | Single process |
| Build requirements | Go toolchain only | CMake, C++ compiler |
| App Store / MSIX ready | No | Yes |
| Sandbox safe | No | Yes |
